# Testing frameworks for data science - a quickstart

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

Basic example on how to write and run tests which are commonly needed for data science projects.

# Instructions

Scripts are compatible with python version 3.x and the packages listed in the file requirements.txt.

To install all required packages in a virtual environment, run the following in terminal:

```
$ python3 -m pyenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run all the tests via terminal:

```
$ python -m unittest
```

Note that the current version shows failed tests to demonstrate what those messages would look like.
